Creation
    extract banking.sql
    sqlite3 banking.db < banking.sql
      WARNING - this fails to create autonum cols
      I had to laod the sql into a db tool (dbviz) to get the database (GEESH)
    ApiLogicServer create --project_name=banking --db_url=sqlite:///banking.db

Changes 
  Added reln AccountType -> Account

  Populated: Branch, Customer, AccountType, Customer, Account, Employees (?)

  Renamed Transaction -> TransactionLog (reserved word, evidently)

Issues
  Transfer attempt: row created with null id to TransactionLog; then blows up in Admin
  curl fails with: Instance '<Transfer at 0x1095283d0>' has been deleted, or its row is otherwise not present.
  Transfer created (with null id!!), but not TransactionLog


Test
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:5656/api/Transfer/' \
  -H 'accept: application/vnd.api+json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
