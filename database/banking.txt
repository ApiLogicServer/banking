Creation
    extract banking.sql
    sqlite3 banking.db < banking.sql
      WARNING - this fails to create autonum cols (sqlite 3.43.2)
      I had to laod the sql into a db tool (dbviz) to get the database (sqlite 3.40.0) (GEESH)
    ApiLogicServer create --project_name=banking --db_url=sqlite:///banking.db

Changes 
  Added reln AccountType -> Account

  Populated: Branch, Customer, AccountType, Customer, Account, Employees (?)

  Renamed Transaction -> TransactionLog (reserved word, evidently)

Issues
  Running, though see database creation notes above

Simpifications to consider
  Defaulting: lots of code here, obscuring key logic
    And, lots of warnings: "default ignored for ..."
      This is eager defaulting, in logic_row.insert()
      It means server_default provided, but unk data type (date[time], and NULL)
    Note
      On recent release, we are tolerate of null sums and counts
      Support for date stamping for known attr names using generic events
    So, we can 
      Use naming convention for account, transaction, tranfer
      Leaving transaction deposit and withdrawal
        Which we could just set in transfer_funds


Test
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:5656/api/Transfer/' \
  -H 'accept: application/vnd.api+json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
